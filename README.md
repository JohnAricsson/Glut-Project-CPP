Maritime Journey Adventure Project using C++ and GLUT
This project utilizes C++ with GLUT and OpenGL to simulate a real-life maritime environment. It involves designing scenes using precise coordinate-based rendering in C++, along with implementing animations and handling user interactions through mouse and keyboard events. The primary goal of this project was to explore and understand GUI development in C++.
